I am starting writing this blog again. Last year, i started this blog thinking that i will write about my coding adventures but soon sloth caught me. I just wrote two posts last year(one of them being just an image).
  
This year i aim to write more in `quantity` and in `quality`.

My new year resolution is to complete the [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) book. I have the hard copy of the book and also have the videos from [MITOCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/)

<!-- more -->

I am doing exercises in MIT Scheme as the book also uses it. I have started with chapter 1 and completed upto `Exercise 1-3`. I am keeping my solutions [here](https://github.com/prathamesh-sonpatki/sicp). I am planning to write my next post about the chapter 1 of SICP.
