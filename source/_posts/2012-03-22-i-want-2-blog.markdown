I was introduced to Octopress by [Vedang Manerikar](http://vedang.me) in his talk on emacs.
I wanted to have a blog for long time but wanted something new, fresh and Octopress is just that.

If you want to learn about basic rake tasks, markdown, git etc; Octopress is just for you :)

### Octopress : Blogging using Git, Github, Ruby

Octopress is a framework designed  for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages by [Brandon Mathis](https://github.com/imathis/).
Detail features are available @ [here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/)

### Getting Started
This tutorial is only for *nix like systems :D
#### Before You Begin
You will need to install [git](git-scm.com/) and setup your ruby enviornment
Octopress requires Ruby 1.9.2 wich you can easily install with [RVM](https://beginrescueend.com/).
#### Get source and install initial dependancies

{% codeblock Download source from Github  %}
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress    # If you use RVM, You'll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file (say yes).
ruby --version  # Should report Ruby 1.9.2
{% endcodeblock %}

Now install dependancies

{% codeblock %}
gem install bundler
bundle install
{% endcodeblock %}

Install the default Octopress theme.

{% codeblock %}
bundle exec rake install
{% endcodeblock %}

A Detailed explanation about bundler is found [here](http://gembundler.com/rationale.html)
